# Women Who Code Manila Ruby on Rails Study Group

**Ruby** is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. (from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

**Ruby on Rails** is a server-side web application framework built with Ruby. It is popular with tech startups since you can quickly build web applications from scratch.

## Getting started

Before attending our study groups, please make sure to install the needed software

### Installation

- All platforms (RailsInstaller): http://www.railsinstaller.org/en
- MacOSX (Rails App): http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html

### Other tools

#### Pry

[Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) is a **better** IRB alternative. This Ruby console has syntax highlighting for better readability when running code in console.

To install pry, run `gem install pry`.

Verify installation by running `pry`.

#### Text editors

Ruby does not require an IDE. You can opt to use one of these as your text editor (or your own choice).

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)\* (all platforms)

\* Warning: Sublime Text shows a popup every hour prompting you to pay if you are using the free version. Please use another editor if you find this annoying.

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (all platforms)
- [Textmate](https://macromates.com/) (OS X only)

For more advanced users, you can opt to use these terminal-based editors:

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
