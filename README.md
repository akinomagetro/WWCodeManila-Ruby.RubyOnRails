# Women Who Code Manila Ruby on Rails Study Group

**Ruby** is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write. (from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

**Ruby on Rails** is a server-side web application framework built with Ruby. It is popular with tech startups since you can quickly build web applications from scratch.
