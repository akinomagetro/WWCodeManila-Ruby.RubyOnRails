# Ruby on Rails guides

This is a guide I compiled for Ruby on Rails learners

## Contents

### Installation

I wrote guides on installing Ruby:

- [MacOSX](https://github.com/kjcpaas/configs/blob/master/docs/installation/mac_osx.md)
- [Windows 10 and Ubuntu](https://github.com/kjcpaas/configs/blob/master/docs/installation/windows_10_and_ubuntu.md)

You may also opt to use the following guides:

- All platforms (RailsInstaller): http://www.railsinstaller.org/en
- MacOSX (Rails App): http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html
- Windows (by Ana Gabutero): https://bitbucket.org/amdg/rails-dev
