# Tools

These tools are not required to run Ruby on Rails but are recommended as they can make your development efficient.

# Pry

[Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) is a **better** IRB alternative. This Ruby console has syntax highlighting for better readability when running code in console.

To install pry, run `gem install pry`.

Verify installation by running `pry`.
